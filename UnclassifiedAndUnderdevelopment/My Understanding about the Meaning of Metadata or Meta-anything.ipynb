    "I first heared metafile in the context of the university subject *Operating System*, where it says that file is an abstraction for data and storage and there are some places that the metadata of a certain file is stored. So basically, A file is a bunch of data for something, and metadata for a file is also a bunch of data for something which itself is a bunch of data. Here you would notice the recursive structure.\n",

    "The same apply to the word *metaverse*. An universe is a bunch of things, and a metaverse is also a bunch of things which themselves are universes. "
