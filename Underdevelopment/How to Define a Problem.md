# How to Define a Problem?  
## Solution  
First of all, a problem should have (or expect) a solution (or a set of solutions).

Given a solution, the assessment can be either objective or subjective. If objective, the assessment should be automated.  
If possible, the assessment should be quantified.

## Degree of Abstraction
Some problems can be fairly abstract, which can produce different problem instances with different parameters.
